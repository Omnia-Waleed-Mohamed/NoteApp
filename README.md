# NoteApp
 Here's a quick overview of the tech stack I used:
Jetpack Compose: for building the UI in a declarative way.
Room Database: for efficient and structured data management.
Voyager: for seamless navigation across screens.
MVVM Architecture and Repository Pattern: to ensure clean and scalable code.
Hilt: for dependency injection, making the codebase more modular and testable.
